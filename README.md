# Functional Extensions

### About

This repository has come to be while I am reading [Functional Programming in Java](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-java) 
by Pierre-Yves Saumont.

In his book, Saumont outlines a series of [exercises](https://github.com/fpinjava/fpinjava) which are used to teach functional programming
paradigms and demonstrate concepts throughout the book. Many of the classes that end up being built are useful to me outside of learning 
and I found myself wanting to use them in my projects. To that end, I've compiled, and made some modifications to, the most useful (to me) elements 
that come from the exercises. 

### Attributions

Many of the ideas, and in some cases exact code, come from the book [Functional Programming in Java](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-java), 
and by extension, Pierre-Yves Saumont. A mix of minor and major changes have been made by myself in some instances, however, it is expected to have a strong likeness
to the aforementioned source.
